# Search-and-Rescue Lego Project

This program implements the 4 levels (Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinium) of requirements for the Search-and-Rescue
project, including an external metal detector, using the Lego Mindstorm EV3 hardware and Python software.

To run the program:
- Upload all files from robot folder (except `__init__.py`)
- Upload `move_and_pickup.py` (or any other file in example folder) to Lego brick in the same directory as previous files
- Set the file `move_and_pickup.py` as executable with `chmod +x <path_to_file>`
- If the code needs to connect to the GUI (dict `GUI_ADDRESS` is defined), run the GUI program first
- Run the file by selecting it in Lego brick.
